# gtfs2googlemaps
my This project is my attempt to, using [GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification) files, map bus lines on Google Maps.

GTFS does not describe bus routes, but rather the stops on the route. This is often not enough information to map the entire route when there are large distances between the stops. 

I am experimenting with the Israel GTFS files that I have downloaded from [Transitfeeds](https://transitfeeds.com/p/ministry-of-transport-and-road-safety/820).

This project is based on [this tutorial](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/02/11/lets-create-software-tutorial-bus-routes-overlaid-on-google-maps/). The tutorial uses a different file format, one that describes the entire bus route.
